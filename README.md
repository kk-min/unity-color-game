## Description
#### Objective of Our Game: <br>
The player needs to navigate through various obstacles and the objective is to reach the end. We have incorporated various interactions centering mostly around running, jumping and shooting. Most importantly, our core game mechanic is based on the concept of colours: Colours are incorporated in the obstacles in a way such that players need to think about them in order to solve the obstacle!
#### Game Mechanics:<br>
1. Each game object (including the player) has a distinct color identity (red, blue, green, etc.).
2. Only objects that are of the same color can collide.
3. Obstacles are designed in such a way that players need to think about color interactions.
4. White is a special color that collides with all other colors.


## Features
1. Interesting Color Puzzle.
2. Various Types of Obstacles.
3. VR Game View & Interaction (Grabbing, Pinching, Shooting).
4. Low Poly Art Style.
5. Intuitive Map Design.
6. Auditory Feedback on Successful Actions (Jumping/Shooting).
